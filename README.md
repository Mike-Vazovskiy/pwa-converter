Website to PWA converter
========================
To start use next commands:
      npm install
      node server.js

This app makes a PWA from your website. Give it a zip-file with your website and one png icon (it`s better to use 512x512), then click "Convert to PWA".
You will get new zip file with new files like manifest.json and sw.js. Your index.html will also be edited.
